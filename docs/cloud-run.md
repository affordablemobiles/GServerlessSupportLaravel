# Cloud Run

In this documentation, we discuss running Laravel (with GaeSupportLaravel) on [fully managed Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/container-contract).

We are using [Google's buildpacks from the App Engine PHP runtimes](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gae-runtimes/EU/buildpacks/php74/builder).

## Supported Features

- [x] Structured Logging in Cloud Logging
- [x] Log attribution via trace id
- [x] Application metrics via Cloud Trace
- [x] Guzzle Integration
- [x] Auth & IAP Integration
- [ ] Cloud Tasks

## Cloud Build Example

See our [Laravel](examples/laravel/buildpack-cloud-run) or [Lumen](examples/lumen/buildpack-cloud-run) examples.

## Runtime differences

### Logging

Unlike App Engine, where we write structured logs to files in `/var/log`, Cloud Run behaves more like Kubernetes, where it expects structured logs to be written to stdout (in the absence of an async client for the Logs API, as in PHP's case).

Writing to stdout directly with:
```php
file_put_contents('php://stdout', json_encode([
    'jsonPayload' => [
        'message' => 'test',
    ],
]));
```
makes it into the logs, but it isn't parsed, as php-fpm adds a prefix, making it invalid JSON.

To get around this, we'll make use of a [custom entrypoint](entrypoint.sh).

This creates a FIFO pipe that we can write to from PHP, while keeping a background process alive that forwards data from the pipe directly to stdout, resulting in structured logs that get parsed with all expected metadata.

**When building with the buildpack, specify the environment variable**:

```
GOOGLE_ENTRYPOINT=/workspace/vendor/a1comms/gae-support-laravel/gcr/entrypoint.sh
```

### Static Assets

Previously with App Engine, you could specify folders & files of static assets in `app.yaml` that would be uploaded & versioned alongside your app, but served independantly of your application's instances.

This isn't possible with Cloud Run, you either have to self-manage & version your assets in Google Cloud Storage, or let your instances serve those assets from the application container.

While the idiomatic method for this in a PHP environment would be to let nginx handle it, this isn't currently supported with Google's buildpacks.

Until a better solution is presented, we emulate how this would work in a Go app, by letting our Laravel application serve the static assets from the public folder:

**To enable the workaround**, add the following to `config/app.php`:

```php
    'providers' => [
        ...
        App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider::class,
        ...

        // Static files for Google Cloud Run
        A1comms\GaeSupportLaravel\Filesystem\StaticFilesServiceProvider::class,
    ],
```

As shown, ensure it sits below the default `RouteServiceProvider`.

**Or alternatively, if you already have a catch-all route, do it via middleware**, although this results in slightly lower performance:

In `app/Http/Kernel.php`:

```php
class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    protected $middleware = [
        ...

        \A1comms\GaeSupportLaravel\Filesystem\StaticFilesMiddleware::class,
    ];
```

### Cloud Tasks

When creating Cloud Tasks on App Engine, we use `Google\Cloud\Tasks\V2\AppEngineHttpRequest` routing objects that are routed within the App Engine platform itself, but this doesn't work for Cloud Run.

Here, you'll need to use `Google\Cloud\Tasks\V2\HttpRequest` objects that route via normal HTTP requests, likely with some form of configured authentication (OAuth2 or OIDC for IAP).

With this in mind, it'll be easier to ignore our wrapper/integration and work with the [underlying client library](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-php/tree/master/Tasks/src/V2) directly.
